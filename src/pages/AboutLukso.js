  aboutLSPs: {
    title: "What are LSPs?",
    quote:
      "The initial 12 LUKSO Standards Proposals (LSPs) represent the core building blocks of the LUKSO ecosystem. LSPs aim to increase functionality and user-friendliness within the blockchain ecosystem and to standardize identity, asset representation and smart contract interaction. The core LSPs are extremely extensible, allowing for many new use cases, while simplifying the developer and user experience. These standards are ‘unbiased’ - meaning they are generic enough to enable new use cases that have not yet been conceived.",

  aboutUPs: {
    title: "What is a Universal Profile?",
    quote:
      "Universal Profiles are interoperable blockchain-based profiles which enable verifiable identities in the digital world. They allow for universal logins that make remembering usernames and passwords a thing of the past, while also giving you full control of all your virtual assets and identity. Universal Profiles simplify the onboarding process to Web3 for users, brands and creators, while also improving accessibility, security and functionality.",

  aboutAssets: {
    title: "What are the NFT and tokens standards on LUKSO?",
    quote:
      "With LSP8 Identifiable Digital Asset as well as LSP7 Digital Asset, NFT and token metadata inputs are very extensible and smart contract readable. The metadata inputs could also be changed over time, allowing NFTs to evolve post-minting. NFTs and tokens on LUKSO can have multiple creators and inform receivers of assets, making complex smart contract automation possible.",
